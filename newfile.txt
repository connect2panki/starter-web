Super Cyclonic Storm Amphan threatens to inflict a devastating blow on one of the most vulnerable places on Earth for tropical weather systems: the mouth of the Bay of Bengal, including parts of India, low-lying Bangladesh and Myanmar.
The storm, rated a Category 5 with maximum sustained winds of 165 mph and gusts to 200 mph, is at the upper end of the storm intensity scale and ranks as the most powerful storm in the Northern Hemisphere so far this year, and the strongest tropical cyclone to occur in the Bay of Bengal. Cyclone Amphan is capable of inflicting catastrophic damage in a heavily populated, low-lying area that has seen high death tolls in past storms.
